#### Overview

These are my course projects from Udacity's [Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning).  This is a stripped downn repo to highlight just the projects - please see Udacity's official GH page for data and environment dependencies.  This was my first taste of deep learning, and this really helped sparked my passion for AI.
